TODO

1. Make notes about context of vector operations like add, sub, mul, transform, dot, cross (math.c)
2. Pull out the threadpool code. Seems pretty useful in a generic sense. 
3. Make vector ops more ingrained in way of thinking (reasoning about add, dot, etc in different ways)

1. Modelling color, what do the r,g,b values we set really mean.
     a. For examples for a emissive material what does (0.3, 0.2, 0.5) values would mean. 
        Are we modelling the energy in some way. In that case can emission materials have rgb components > 1.0
        Why the 1.0 limit, are we modelling the limit inherent to the universe or is it a limitation of the "camera"

     b. What do these same color values mean for diffuse materials (the albedo?)
        If a material is of value (0.7, 0.2, 0.2) (reddish?) it mean red light is reflected at a higher rate than g and b
        So are these basically attenuation values 
        i.e. for example say we have an incoming ray of light with value (0.3, 0.9, 0.8)
        Would this be attenuated to lower values where the red light is attenuated to a lesser extent to b and g
        What does this formula look like and why (is it a simple hadamard mul)

     c. For metals are their colors different physically than diffuse in some ways (since they have high reflectivity 
        but some of them clearly have distinct colors so something is getting absorbed)

2. How do we model diffuse and specular components of a material?
   Current Understading:
   Diffuse: Incoming ray of light can bounce in any direction. 
			So pick a random point in hemisphere (on the tangent plane) and reflect in that direction
            Also we need to consider that the ray could have bounce in any direction
            So we adjust by a factor of 2*pi (otherwise we break energy conservation laws???)
            NOTE: 2*pi deriving from -> area of hemisphere 2*pi*r^2 (unit sphere r = 1) -> 2*pi

   Mirror:  Outgoing rays area are perfect reflection of the incoming ray about the normal 
            Also how is color modelled here (can perfect mirrors tint light rays)
            Are they 2 separate things?. Mirrors about reflection angle, color about intensity absorbtion

   Glossy:  A mix between diffuse and mirror. The reflected rays should be biased towards the perfect reflection 
            using some factor, to say how much to bias. 
            How to do this?? Micro facets??
            And does this modelling alone gie us specular highlights


3. Specular highlights are caused when the angle between light -> surface and surface -> eye is 
   perfectly bisected by the normal.
   How is this modelled in the path tracing.
   Is this handled by the stuff that handles glossy reflections (doesn't seem to)

4. What is gamma correct. What is sRGB
   Is gamma correct only for the fact that in the scene we are representing colors and lights 
   in terms on intensity (like in the real world)

   But when we finally get to render these color, we need to take some root, (like how cameras does), to increase 
   the overall dynamic range our pixel bytes can represent.
   So we exploit the fact that human are good at detecting changes in relative intensity vs change in absolute intensity

   e.g. Change from 0.1 -> 0.2 is more perceptible than 0.8 -> 0.9
   
   So by taking the sqrt, we give more bit essentialy to lower end of the changes

5. What is BRDF?? 
   The equation we use (work most well for diffuse only it seems)
   Where mat is the material of the current object reflecting the ray

    p = 1 / 2pi // 1 / 2pi because of the thing I mentioned regarding area and probs

    cos = angle between out_dir and normal

    brdf = mat.diffuse_color * (1 / pi) // related to p??

    t = incoming_color * (cos / p) // why this at all. Is the cos there because of lambertian, why divide by p

    outgoing_color = mat.emit_color + t * brdf // emit color makes sense. 

6. What exactly is PBR (Physcially Based Rendering). How are they implemented in a path tracer vs a game engine

7. Word Meanings: Intensity, Luminence, Radiosity.
